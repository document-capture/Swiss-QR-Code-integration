# Document Capture Advanced Swiss QR-Code Management #

## About this solution ##
This Business Central app enables you to process the Swiss payment QR code recognized via OCR from [Continia Document Capture](https://www.continia.com). The solution searches for a valid QR code during the registration process of the document (CDC Document table) and transfers it to the fields of the official Microsoft Business Central fields in the Swiss localization.
