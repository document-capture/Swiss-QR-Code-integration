# Document-Capture-Swiss-QR-Code

## About this solution ##
This Business Central Extension allows to process the Swiss payment QR code recognized via OCR with [Continia Document Capture](https://www.continia.com). The solution searches for a valid QR code during registration in the document (CDC Document table) and transfers it to the fields of the official Microsoft extension "QR-Bill Management for Switzerland".

## Version ##
The version is based on Business Central Version Spring 2019 (14) - Cumulative Update 13 for Swiss localization.
