### About this solution

This Business Central app enables you to process Swiss payment QR codes that have been recognized from OCR in [Continia Document Capture](https://www.continia.com). The solution identifies valid QR code(s) and includes the following features:

* Identify the vendor based on the IBAN that is recognized from the QR code
* Validation check if the captured invoice amount is equal to the amount of the QR code
* Transfer QR code content while document registration (creation of purchase invoice) and transfers it to the fields of the official Microsoft Business Central fields in the Swiss QR Bill app.
