### About this solution

This Business Central app enables you to process the Swiss payment QR code recognized via OCR from [Continia Document Capture](https://www.continia.com). The solution searches for a valid QR code during the registration process of the document (CDC Document table) and transfers it to the fields of the official Microsoft Business Central fields in the Swiss localization.

### Supported versions
